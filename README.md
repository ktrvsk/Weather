* Used API for getting weather data: https://openweathermap.org/current (provides data only at a given point in time).
* When logging in for the first time to access the weather in his city, the user only needs to allow the application to use his current geo-position, on which the application will reflect the weather on the main screen. 
* If necessary, on the main screen, the user can view weather conditions anywhere in the world using the search bar. To return to the current geo-position, you only need to use the button in the upper left corner.
* Implemented the function to add a new city (button in the lower right corner).
* Supports adaptation to light and dark screen themes.
* The project uses SF Symbols. Install by following the link: https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/sf-symbols/overview/
